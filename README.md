Hello. The Mezzanine folder contains the main Mezzanine open source project, while the project name folder contains the individual project.In particular, the Mezzanine folder contains the mezzanine cms framework, while the project_name folder contains specific settings for the SQ site.  I have made changes and modifications to both these folders but mostly the Mezzanine folder in terms of html templates, urls.py and views.py because Mezzanine provides most of the back end functionality, I just had to change the aesthetics of the different admin pages and menus for different users.
